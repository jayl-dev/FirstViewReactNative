## Usage

To use, you will need to have a FirstView account created using the official app and login.

The rest is pretty much the same as the official FirstView app, with the following enhancements 

1. The map screen has no title bar and the student/route list view can be hidden. This allows the screen to show up much better in a multi-task small window.

2. It adds auto map panning to track the bus and student on the map
